# guardrails shared helpers — POSIX sh, sourced by the check/finalize scripts.
# Scripts run from the target repo root. GR_CONFIG overrides the config path.
#
# Several helpers below call gr_die, which exits 2. A helper invoked inside a
# command substitution dies only in that subshell, so EVERY `x=$(gr_...)` call
# site must append `|| exit 2` — otherwise the caller sails past the error with
# an empty value, which is the exact false-green failure these checks exist to
# prevent.

# The annotation-list rule as an awk function, defined ONCE and prepended to
# every awk program that needs it. gr_id_run(line, kw) returns the space-
# separated IDs of the list immediately following the FIRST occurrence of kw on
# line; the run ends at the first character that is not an ID, comma or space,
# so `verifies: REQ-001 (was REQ-042)` yields REQ-001 alone — prose after the
# list is commentary, never coverage.
#
# One definition is the point. Three near-copies of this rule is how `traces:`
# came to demand a REQ at the head of its run while `satisfies:` scanned from
# the LAST occurrence on the line and credited a REQ mentioned in prose.
